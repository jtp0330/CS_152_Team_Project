# CS_157A_Team_Project
The following repository holds MySQL, Java, and documentation Files to implement a Plugin Database for the CS 157A course at San Jose State University.
During the project, I wrote various queries, utilizing different MySQL operations, collaborated with other team members to construct tables for our database.
I am not including the whole project, but pieces of code that I wrote for the project, regardless if they were used or not.
